		Andrey's Portfolio!

	<h1>Andrey Miroshnikov - Андрей Мирошников</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a student with a passion in electronics. Since 2011, I have been learning about this subject mainly outside of the classroom as electronics was (and still is) niche in schools and sixth forms.
		My main objective is to develop better components and systems (be they passive, active, analogue or digital) to improve everyday aspects of life (travel, computer interaction, automation) as well as make space travel more accessible.
	</p>
	<h1>What is this?</h1>
	<p>
		This will soon become a portfolio for my projects!
